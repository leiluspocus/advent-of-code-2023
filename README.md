Advent of Code 2023 ðŸŽ… (TDD + Node.js) - Will I complete it this year ? ðŸ”®

## Day 1

What a rollercoaster of emotions ! ðŸŽ¢

From "Easy peasy, lemon squeezie ðŸ˜Ž" to "I hate Christmas ðŸ¤¬, I hate myself ðŸ˜­, why am I doing this ðŸ« " to "OMG, is it actually working ? ðŸ¥¹"

- I tried to handle zero cases ... It was not necessary ðŸ¤¡
- For puzzle 2, I first simply tried to iterate through a digit array and replace occurences. Of course, overlapping cases (like "zoneight") revealed bugs.
- I thought "zoneight" was supposed to return 11... It was actually supposed to return 18 ðŸ¤¡ (Thanks again Sara!)
- My way to handle puzzle 2 was to sanitize the overlapping characters first, then replace the occurences.
- ðŸ’œ `replaceAll`
- ðŸ’¡ TIL: Read the text carefully and in your communities you shall trust! (So much love for you Sara ðŸ’œ)

## Day 2
- This time, I stick to the case given in the website and... it's done in 30mn! ðŸ¥³
- I approach things little by little: I used [Regex101](https://regex101.com/r/hDYqxN/1) to help me figuring out the regex to extract my game ID, how to construct my colors object ... Baby steps encouraged by TDD are not my strongest asset ...
- I'm thinking about having a helper file for functions that are used by several days (it's likely i'll have to read in a file everyday this month...)
- ðŸ’œ Approaching this in a TDD way **definitely** helps !
- I got stuck on an error on my Regexp that was not isolating the game ID properly ... (see this commit to handle game IDs that are on 2/3 digits) That was a tricky one!
